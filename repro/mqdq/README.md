# MQDQ XML Files

These files have been downloaded from [MQDQ](http://mizar.unive.it/mqdq/public/index). Some files have been modified to improve automatic parsing in ways that might damage their fidelity as manuscripts (removal of athetised lines, removal of some special symbols, etc.).

The current license for files from that archive is [CC-BY-NC-ND 4.0](http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/4.0/legalcode), although not all of the XML files here contain that in the header, because some were downloaded before the license was included. Never the less they are included here under that license, and copyright remains with MQDQ.
